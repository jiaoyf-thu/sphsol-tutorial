.. Note:: Modify the ``Input/`` files to customise your simulation scenario.

The initial states of SPH particles are defined in ``Input/0-Particles.csv``, which can be generated by modifying ``PrePost/example/test.py``.
The particles' ID, position, velocity, part ID, mass and density are necessary and should be formatted as

.. csv-table:: 0-Particles
  :header: "ID","X","Y","Z","VX","VY","VZ","PART","MASS","DENSITY"

  "0","0.0e0","0.0e0","0.0e0","0.0e0","0.0e0","0.0e0",0,"0.0e0","0.0e0"
  "1","0.0e0","0.0e0","0.0e0","0.0e0","0.0e0","0.0e0",0,"0.0e0","0.0e0"
