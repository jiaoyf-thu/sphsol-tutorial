.. Note:: Modify the ``Input/`` files to customise your simulation scenario.

The initial states of SPH particles are defined in ``Input/0-Particles.csv``, which can be generated by modifying ``PrePost/example/test.py``.
The particles' ID, position, velocity, part ID, mass and density are necessary and should be formatted as (*optional)
